          <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
          <p>We couldn’t be happier with the service we
             received from Grade Potential. Our daughter has missed several
             weeks due to illness and was faced with a mountain of makeup work.
             The tutor provided by Grade Potential turned the mountain into a
             molehill in no time. Our daughter finished the year with a 3.8 GPA.
             It wouldn’t have happened without Grade Potential.</p>

              Knowing how to take standardized tests well is
              an acquired ability for many students–and that’s 
              why Grade Potential offers test prep tutoring catered to you.
              We know how important it is to head into standardized tests
              feeling confident and able to perform when it counts</p>
